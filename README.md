# Methods

Implement pollen-climate models for benchmark testing.

Performs k-fold cross validation for a calibration pollen data set.

Methods implemented include:
* Modern Analogue Technique
* Weighted-Averaging

Current statistics used to assess model calibration quality are:
* MSPE: Mean Squared Prediction Error
* AME: Absolute Mean Error
* CRPS: Continuous Ranked Probability Score
* coverage: Empirical 95% coverage rate
